    "Plains Grassy Woodland is an open, sunlit woodland once widespread across the heavy basalt clays of western Victoria. Scattered River Red Gums, Grey Box, and Yellow Gums form a broad canopy over a ground layer rich with kangaroo grass, native lilies, wildflowers, and seasonal herbs. This EVC thrives in landscapes with seasonal waterlogging and cracking clay soils, and is shaped by a long history of fire management and Aboriginal cultivation. Today, less than 3% of this ecosystem remains, making it one of Victoria’s most threatened woodland communities. With a low shrub layer and high herb diversity, Plains Grassy Woodland forms a vital link between grassland and forest — a spacious, grassy ecosystem built on story, fire, and deep time.",
