                <h2>What is an EVC?</h2>
                <p>An Ecological Vegetation Class (EVC) is a standardised vegetation classification system used in Victoria. Each EVC represents a distinct native vegetation community characterised by its plant species composition, habitat structure, and ecological processes.</p>
                <p>The EVC framework was developed by the Victorian Government to map and describe the state's diverse native vegetation. It provides a consistent language for discussing vegetation patterns across different bioregions.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Why EVCs matter for gardens</h2>
                <p>Understanding your local EVC helps you select indigenous plants that would naturally occur in your area. These plants are adapted to local soil types, rainfall patterns, and ecological relationships.</p>
                <p>By choosing plants from your EVC, you create habitat that supports local wildlife, contributes to ecological connectivity, and helps restore the indigenous character of your landscape.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>How EVCs are mapped</h2>
                <p>EVC mapping is based on vegetation surveys, satellite imagery, soil types, topography, and historical records. The Victorian Government maintains the authoritative EVC mapping dataset, which is regularly updated as new information becomes available.</p>
                <p>EVC boundaries represent the best available ecological information, but they are inherently complex. Vegetation communities transition gradually across landscapes, and historical clearing has fragmented many remnant areas.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Understanding boundaries</h2>
                <p>EVC boundaries are ecological approximations, not precise legal boundaries. At the edges of EVC zones, vegetation communities often intergrade or form mosaics. Your property may sit within a transitional area where multiple EVCs overlap.</p>
                <p>The EVC identified for your address represents the most likely native vegetation community based on current mapping. For specific planting advice, consider consulting local ecological references or visiting nearby remnant vegetation.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Conservation status</h2>
                <p>Many EVCs are listed as endangered, vulnerable, or depleted due to historical land clearing. Understanding the conservation status of your local EVC highlights the ecological importance of restoring indigenous vegetation in gardens and public spaces.</p>
